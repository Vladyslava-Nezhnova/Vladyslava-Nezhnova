- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vladyslava-Nezhnova
-  Pronouns: She/Her.
-  Interested in automation testing.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on developing testing tools and frameworks.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at vldnezhnova@gmail.com.
- ☘️ Fun fact: Sometimes I catch myself not only testing projects but also applying testing scenarios to everyday life situations.
  It seems like my brain often runs its own "debug mode" to troubleshoot daily challenges!
